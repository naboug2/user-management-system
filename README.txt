Overview
This project is designed to manage user data by generating random passwords and providing a simple login mechanism. The system consists of two main scripts:
1. create.py: Generates random passwords for users and saves them to a file.
2. login.py: Provides a login interface for users to authenticate with their email and password.


Files
-create.py: Script to create users with generated passwords.
-login.py: Script to login users by verifying their credentials.
-UIN.txt: File containing user UINs (University Identification Numbers).
-NetID.txt: File containing user NetIDs.
-users.txt: File generated by create.py containing user emails and passwords.


Usage
create.py - This script generates a random password for each user and saves their email and password to users.txt. The passwords are composed of upper and lower case vowels and are between 4 and 8 characters long. No adjacent vowels in the password are the same (case insensitive).
Steps:
-Read UINs from UIN.txt.
-Read NetIDs from NetID.txt.
-Generate an email (NetID@uic.edu) and a random password for each user.
-Save the email and password to users.txt.

login.py - This script allows users to login by entering their email and password. The script reads the users.txt file to verify the credentials.
Steps:
-Prompt the user for their email and password.
-Read the users.txt file to check if the email exists.
-If the email exists, check if the password matches.
-Display appropriate messages based on the authentication result.

Running the Scripts
1. Ensure UIN.txt and NetID.txt files are present in the specified directory with proper data.
2. Run:python create.py
This will generate the users.txt file with the users' email addresses and passwords.
3. Run: python login.py
This will prompt the user to enter their email and password and will display whether the login was successful or not.
